**AI Behavior:**
- Uses actual flashcards from the folder
- Asks one question at a time
- Waits for student's answer
- Provides detailed feedback:
  - ‚úÖ If correct: Reinforces understanding
  - ‚ùå If incorrect: Explains the correct answer and why
- Keeps track of progress (e.g., "You got 4 out of 5 correct!")
- Offers to continue or focus on missed questions

**Example Interaction:**
```
Student: "Quiz me on my flashcards"

AI: "Great! I see you have 10 flashcards about World War II. Let's start!

Question 1: What year did World War II begin?

Take your time and answer when ready."

Student: "1939"

AI: "‚úÖ Correct! World War II began in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. 

This is important because it marks the start of the largest conflict in human history. Do you want to continue to the next question?"
```

### **Explain Mode**
When students ask: *"What is...?"* or *"Can you explain...?"*

**AI Behavior:**
- Breaks down concepts into simple terms
- Uses examples and analogies
- References their notes if available
- Suggests related topics
- Checks understanding with follow-up questions

**Example Interaction:**
```
Student: "Can you explain photosynthesis?"

AI: "Let me break down photosynthesis for you! üìö

**Simple Definition:**
Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

**Think of it like this:**
Imagine a plant as a tiny solar-powered factory. The leaves are solar panels that capture sunlight. The factory takes in CO‚ÇÇ (from air) and H‚ÇÇO (from roots), then uses solar energy to create glucose (sugar) and releases O‚ÇÇ (oxygen) as a byproduct.

**The Formula:**
6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO + Light Energy ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ + 6O‚ÇÇ

I noticed you have notes about biology - would you like me to connect this to cellular respiration, which is the opposite process?"
```

### **Review Mode**
When students say: *"Help me prepare for my exam"* or *"Review my notes"*

**AI Behavior:**
- Summarizes key concepts from notes
- Identifies most important topics
- Creates practice questions
- Suggests study schedule
- Highlights areas needing more focus

**Example Interaction:**
```
Student: "I have an exam on Python next week. Help me review."

AI: "Let's create a solid review plan! I can see you have 5 notes about Python. Here's what we should focus on:

**High Priority Topics:**
1. Functions and Parameters (appears in 3 notes)
2. Loops (for and while)
3. Data Structures (lists, dictionaries)

**Study Plan:**
- Days 1-2: Review functions, practice writing them
- Days 3-4: Master loops with exercises
- Days 5-6: Data structures and practice problems
- Day 7: Full review and practice exam

Would you like me to quiz you on functions first, or would you prefer I create practice problems?"
```

### **Brainstorm Mode**
When students say: *"I need help with my assignment"* or *"I'm working on a project"*

**AI Behavior:**
- Helps organize thoughts
- Suggests research directions
- Provides structure and outlines
- Encourages critical thinking
- Asks guiding questions (Socratic method)

**Example Interaction:**
```
Student: "I need to write an essay about climate change but I don't know where to start"

AI: "Let's break this down together! üí°

**First, let's clarify:**
1. What's the specific angle? (causes, effects, solutions, policy?)
2. How long should it be?
3. What's your main argument or thesis?

**Potential Structure:**
I. Introduction
   - Hook (interesting fact/statistic)
   - Thesis statement
   
II. Body
   - Causes of climate change
   - Current effects
   - Future predictions
   - Possible solutions
   
III. Conclusion

Here's our game plan:
1. Quick summary of key concepts (5 min)
2. Rapid-fire flashcard quiz (10 min)
3. Focus on topics you missed (10 min)

Ready? Let's start with the most important concepts from your notes..."
```

### **2. Concept Clarification**
```
Student: "I don't understand recursion in programming"

AI: "Recursion can be tricky! Let me explain it with a simple analogy.

Imagine you're looking for your keys in a messy room:
1. Check the current spot
2. If not there, divide the room into sections
3. Check each section the same way (this is recursion!)
4. Keep dividing until you find the keys

In code, a recursive function calls itself with a smaller problem until it reaches a base case.

Based on your Python notes, let me show you a simple example..."
```

### **3. Study Session**
```
Student: "Let's do a study session on my chemistry flashcards"

AI: "Perfect! I see you have 12 chemistry flashcards. Let's make this interactive!

I'll quiz you, and after each answer, I'll explain the concept deeper. We'll track your score and focus on any topics you find challenging.
